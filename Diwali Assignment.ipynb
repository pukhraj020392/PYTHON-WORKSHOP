    "Imagine you and your friends are planning to have dinner and lies in fornt of you is the toughest decision to choose a place to eat. After a while into planning you will find yourself in a situation where you start asking questions which needs to be answered in order to come to a decision. You would end up asking questions like what cuisine to choose from? or what is the best cafe in a certain vicinity? Whatever question answer you do before coming to conclusion is what data scientists call 'Exploratory Data Analysis'."
